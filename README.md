# Eris Package Manager: The Smart Contract Package Manager

```
The Eris Package Manager Deploys and Tests Smart Contract Systems
```

EPM is a high level tool which provides easy access to most of the eris:db tooling. EPM is used to deploy and test suites of smart contracts. In general it will wrap the mint-client tooling, along with eris-keys and eris-compilers to provide a harmonized interface to the modular components of the [eris](https://docs.erisindustries.com) open source platform.

EPM is closer to an ansible or chef like tool than it is NPM in that it is a deployment sequence and testing tool. EPM uses an **epm definition file** to tell the package manager what jobs should be ran and in what order.

In EPM a *job* is a single action which is performed (such as a transaction, a contract deployment, a call to a smart contract, or a query of information). The results of these jobs are then kept in variables and may be used in later jobs.

## Install

1. [Install go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Ensure you have gmp installed (sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev || brew install gmp)
3. `go get github.com/eris-ltd/eris-pm/cmd/epm`

Complete documentation is available at https://docs.erisindustries.com

Version:
  0.11.3

Usage:
  epm [flags]

Flags:
  -a, --abi-path="./abi": path to the abi directory EPM should use when saving ABIs after the compile process; default respects $EPM_ABI_PATH
  -r, --address="": default address to use; operates the same way as the [account] job, only before the epm file is ran; default respects $EPM_ADDRESS
  -u, --amount="9999": default amount to use; default respects $EPM_AMOUNT
  -c, --chain="localhost:46657": <ip:port> of chain which EPM should use; default respects $EPM_CHAIN_ADDR
  -m, --compiler="https://compilers.eris.industries:10114": <ip:port> of compiler which EPM should use; default respects $EPM_COMPILER_ADDR
  -p, --contracts-path="./contracts": path to the contracts EPM should use; default respects $EPM_CONTRACTS_PATH
  -d, --debug=false: debug level output; the most output available for epm; if it is too chatty use verbose flag; default respects $EPM_DEBUG
  -n, --fee="1234": default fee to use; default respects $EPM_FEE
  -f, --file="./epm.yaml": path to package file which EPM should use; default respects $EPM_FILE
  -g, --gas="1111111111": default gas to use; can be overridden for any single job; default respects $EPM_GAS
  -h, --help=false: help for epm
  -o, --output="csv": output format which epm should use [csv,json]; default respects $EPM_OUTPUT_FORMAT
  -e, --set=: default sets to use; operates the same way as the [set] jobs, only before the epm file is ran (and after default address; default respects $EPM_SETS
  -s, --sign="localhost:4767": <ip:port> of signer daemon which EPM should use; default respects $EPM_SIGNER_ADDR
  -t, --summary=true: output a table summarizing epm jobs; default respects $EPM_SUMMARY_TABLE
  -v, --verbose=false: verbose output; more output than no output flags; less output than debug level; default respects $EPM_VERBOSE
```

EPM is a simple tool from the command line perspective in that it does not have subcommands. `epm` is the only command it will run. This command will execute the instructions of the epm definition file in the current directory (unless a different file is given via the `--file` flag or `$EPM_FILE` environment variable).

## EPM Definition Files

Sample EPM definition file, typically saved as a `epm.yaml` file.

```yaml
jobs:
- name: account1
  job:
    account:
      address: 1040E6521541DAB4E7EE57F21226DD17CE9F0FB7

- name: val1
  job:
    set:
      val: 1234

- name: sendTxTest1
  job:
    send:
      source: $account1
      destination: 58FD1799AA32DED3F6EAC096A1DC77834A446B9C
      amount: $val1
      wait: true

- name: val1
  job:
    set:
      val: "eris_loves"

- name: val2
  job:
    set:
      val: "marmots"

- name: MinersFee
  job:
    set:
      val: 1234

- name: nameRegTest1
  job:
    register:
      name: $val1
      data: $val2
      fee: $MinersFee
      wait: true

- name: account_tgt
  job:
    set:
      val: 58FD1799AA32DED3F6EAC096A1DC77834A446B9C

- name: perm
  job:
    set:
      val: call

- name: permTest2
  job:
    permission:
      action: unset_base
      target: $account_tgt
      permission: $perm
      wait: false

- name: setStorage
  job:
    set:
      val: 0x5

- name: deployStorageK
  job:
    deploy:
      contract: storage.sol
      wait: true

- name: setStorage
  job:
    call:
      destination: $deployStorageK
      data: set $setStorage
      wait: true
```

For more about the jobs epm is capable of performing please see the [Jobs Specification](https://docs.erisindustries.com/documentation/eris-pm/latest/jobs_specification/).

## Variable Handling

EPM will also handle variables; for more information please see the [Variables Specification](https://docs.erisindustries.com/documentation/eris-pm/latest/variable_specification/).

EPM will save an `epm.log` file with the variables used and results of the jobs in the `pwd` unless another location is specified.
